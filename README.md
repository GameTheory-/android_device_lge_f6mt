Work in Progress
================

Currently only builds for Clockworkmod Recovery

My tree is specifically for the LG Optimus F6 MS500/f6mt from MetroPCS, but should work for the other variants as well, esp with a few minor edits and correct kernel/src/defconfig (dont know if they are cross compatible yet).
