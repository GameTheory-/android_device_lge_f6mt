Work in Progress
================

My tree is specifically for the MS659 from MetroPCS, but should work for the other variants as well, esp with a few minor edits.

PeterCassetta has a repo for the T-Mobile variant @ https://github.com/PeterCassetta/android_device_lge_fx3

jmztaylor has a repo for the Virgin Mobile variant @ https://github.com/jmztaylor/android_device_lg_ls720
